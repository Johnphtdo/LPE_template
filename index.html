          <p class="about-description">
            The DFW area has a large Asian American demographic, therefore at the
            University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), there is a large Asian
            American community because many students would commute from the
            surrounding area. The school was inclusive with different student
            organizations, but the Asian American community was still missing an
            Asian interest fraternity or sorority. Nam Doan and Anthony Nguyen
            visited different campuses in search of the best organization and was
            inspired to bring Lambda Phi Epsilon to UTA. Thus, the Altruistic
            Asian Association (AAA) was created on January 25th, 2012, as an
            interest group to charter Lambda Phi Epsilon. In late 2012, almost a
            year of hard work and determination, AAA was extended an offer to
            charter. By April 7th, 2013, after being educated on how to operate
            and lead a Lambda Phi Epsilon chapter, the following men officially
            crossed as Charter Class: Charlie Danh, John Do, Johnny Do, Nam Doan,
            Tony Ho, Hai Lam, Matt Lu, Anthony Nguyen, Tommy Nguyen, Joe Tran, Lac
            Tran, and Michael Tran. With their guidance, the chapter became a
            prominent organization and created more interest for Greek culture
            among the Asian American students. By May 26, 2019, the chapter
            received their official letters and became the Beta Beta Chapter of
            Lambda Phi Epsilon.
