                Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization that will challenge every
                aspect of your college life. The road to becoming a brother of
                Lambda Phi Epsilon is not easy as it requires drive and
                dedication towards achieving the organization’s various goals,
                but the rewards are well worth it. New members enter into a
                brotherhood that is rich in tradition and strong in its bonds
                while learning how to become a leader in their schools, their
                communities, and the real world. It takes a certain type of man
                to become a Lambda—someone who wants to become a leader among
                men.
              </p>
              <p>Perhaps that's you!</p>
              <p>
                Many brothers have said that the reason they joined Lambda Phi
                Epsilon was because they could see and feel a sense of
                brotherhood among the existing members that they could not find
                elsewhere. However, the brotherhood extends far beyond the reach
                of a single school. With chapters across the country, brothers
                have a chance to network with others from all over, bringing
                with it many new opportunities and friendships. Membership does
                not end with the undergraduate years. Numerous alumni
                associations exist all across the country, bringing both newly
                graduated brothers and those with more experience in the real
                world to continue their contribution to society.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lambda Phi Epsilon not only seeks to bring together a diverse
                group of men who share common interests, concerns, backgrounds,
                and cultures, but those who show the confidence of a leader.
                This leadership is pivotal in achieving the goals of the
                fraternity, which include servicing the community through
                various philanthropies, increasing Asian awareness, promoting
                academic scholarship, and strengthening the Asian American voice
                in the community. Each brother has a vital role in making these
                goals attainable, and the principles that they learn are passed
                down to new members in hopes that they will become the next
                generation of leaders among men.

                    Rush is a period at the beginning of the school quarter or
                    semester when anyone interested in Greek life can attend
                    events set up by a local chapter to meet its members and
                    learn more about their organization. Rush usually lasts
                    about 1-2 weeks, with events held every day that showcase
                    various aspects of the fraternity.

                    While you are encouraged to learn more about the Greek
                    system, we want you to remember why you are at school in the
                    first place. Lambda Phi Epsilon’s first and foremost purpose
                    is to promote academic achievement and this priority is
                    stressed even to current members. Like any worthwhile

                    some time and effort. Managing school and joining a
                    fraternity is definitely possible, though, and part of
                    becoming a Lambda is learning how to handle these challenges
                    and become a responsible, well-rounded individual that
                    optimizes time management. The active members of the
                    fraternity are students as well, and they will be committed
                    to ensuring your academic success. Be sure to find the right
                    balance to have a rewarding college life both academically
                    and socially.

                    you accept the opportunity to complete the new member
                    education process of Lambda Phi Epsilon, the possibilities
                    are endless. Stressing skills such as leadership,
